# User Service System Architecture

## Overview
This project is centered around the concept of **"Time + Covariates → Prediction → Action"**. The system gathers user behavior data, preprocesses it, segments customers using clustering methods (e.g., K-Means, DBSCAN), and trains survival models (such as Cox Proportional Hazards) for each segment. Predictions, such as time to churn or time to the next visit, are utilized to update retention and CLV metrics while personalizing marketing campaigns.

## Modules
The system is divided into several interconnected modules:

### 1. Data Preprocessing Module
- **Functions**:
  - Data cleaning (handling outliers and missing values).
  - Metric normalization and scaling (e.g., RFM: Recency, Frequency, Monetary).
  - Computing additional metrics (e.g., Time Between Purchases - TBP).
  - Generating time series for state transitions analysis.
- **Outputs**:
  - Aggregated metrics for RFM, TBP, and sessions.

### 2. Segmentation Module
- **Functions**:
  - Clustering users using K-Means and DBSCAN.
  - Types:
    - RFM segmentation.
    - Behavioral patterns segmentation.
    - Demographic segmentation.
    - Sensitivity to promotions segmentation.
- **Outputs**:
  - Labels for user segments (e.g., VIP clients, seasonal clients).

### 3. Survival Analysis Module
- **Functions**:
  - Predicting time until key events (e.g., churn, next visit, inactivity).
  - Training survival models for each segment using covariates.
  - Interpreting model coefficients to inform risks.
- **Outputs**:
  - Survival functions, hazard coefficients.

### 4. State Transition Analyzer
- **Functions**:
  - Creating transition matrices using Markov chains.
  - Updating matrices regularly based on new data.
- **Outputs**:
  - Probabilities for user state transitions.

### 5. Retention Predictor
- **Functions**:
  - Calculating retention rates and churn probabilities.
  - Combining survival analysis outputs with transition matrices.
- **Outputs**:
  - Expected retention metrics.

### 6. CLV Updater
- **Functions**:
  - Updating Customer Lifetime Value using retention predictions.
  - Discounting future revenue based on churn forecasts.
- **Outputs**:
  - Adjusted CLV values.

### 7. API & Reporting Module
- **Functions**:
  - Exposing REST APIs for external systems (e.g., CRM, marketing).
  - Generating dashboards for visualization.
- **Outputs**:
  - Interactive visualizations and aggregated metrics.

## Implementation Workflow
1. **Data Collection**: Gather user profiles, transactions, and session logs.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and normalize the collected data.
3. **Segmentation**: Cluster users based on metrics like RFM, TBP, and behavior.
4. **Survival Analysis**: Train segment-specific models to predict user behavior.
5. **State Transition Analysis**: Construct transition matrices for retention updates.
6. **Retention Prediction**: Forecast churn probabilities and retention rates.
7. **CLV Update**: Recalculate CLV based on updated retention metrics.
8. **Reporting & API**: Share insights via dashboards and APIs.

## Key Features
- **Modular Design**: Independent modules for preprocessing, segmentation, prediction, and reporting.
- **Scalability**: Designed for microservice architecture.
- **Optimization**: Regular model updates and parameter tuning based on new data.

## Database Structure
