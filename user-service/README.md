1. Package: data_preprocessing
Purpose: Handle data cleaning, normalization, and metric preparation.

Main Structs:

DataCleaner (Handles outliers, missing values):

Fields:

rawData (private): Stores the raw input data.

cleanedData (private): Cleaned data ready for further processing.

Interface: IDataProcessor

MetricCalculator (Calculates TBP, RFM metrics, etc.):

Fields:

userMetrics (private): Processed metrics for users.

scaledMetrics (private): Normalized data.

Interface: IDataProcessor

Encapsulation:

Keep raw data and internal processing logic private.

Provide methods to access only processed/aggregated metrics.

2. Package: segmentation
Purpose: Manage user clustering and grouping.

Main Structs:

RFMClustering:

Fields:

rfmClusters (private): Stores clustering results for RFM.

clusterCentroids (private): Centroids of clusters.

Interface: IClusterAlgorithm

BehaviorClustering:

Fields:

patterns (private): Time-based patterns for clusters.

Interface: IClusterAlgorithm

Encapsulation:

Clustering data is private and only accessible through summary statistics (e.g., centroids).

3. Package: survival_analysis
Purpose: Implement survival modeling for each segment.

Main Structs:

SurvivalModel:

Fields:

modelCoefficients (private): Stores CoxPH or similar coefficients.

survivalFunctions (private): Maps for each segment.

Interface: ISurvivalPredictor

Encapsulation:

Model coefficients and detailed functions are private. Public APIs return predictions only.

4. Package: state_transition
Purpose: Create and update Markov chain transition matrices.

Main Structs:

TransitionMatrix:

Fields:

matrix (private): Transition probabilities.

segments (private): Related user segments.

Interface: ITransitionManager

Encapsulation:

Purpose: Forecast retention and churn probabilities.

Main Structs:

RetentionCalculator:

Fields:

churnProbability (private): Probabilities of churn.

lifetimeValue (private): Estimated retention metrics.

Interface: IPredictionManager

Encapsulation:

Churn calculations are hidden. Outputs like retention curves are accessible via public methods.

6. Package: clv_updater
Purpose: Calculate and update Customer Lifetime Value (CLV).

Main Structs:

CLVCalculator:

Fields:

discountRate (private): Factor used for discounting future revenue.

updatedCLV (private): Adjusted CLV values.

Interface: IUpdater

Encapsulation:

Hide intermediate CLV updates; expose only the final value.

7. Package: reporting_api
Purpose: Provide REST APIs and dashboards.

Main Structs:

APIHandler:

Fields:

endpoints (private): List of available API endpoints.

Interface: IAPIManager

Encapsulation:

Internal API logic is private. Endpoints expose data securely.
